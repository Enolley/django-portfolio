                    My name is Julie Anne Enola and I am a web developer. Well, that's what the rest of this portfolio talks about. In this section I want to list a few things about me. My hobbies include travelling, listening and making music and event organizing. I've also participated in other activities like shotput competition in high school, I emerged third.
